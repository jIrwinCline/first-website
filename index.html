		<!-- Introduction-->
		<section class="center">
			<h1>Welcome!</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Jacob Irwin-Cline. I began my professional career with high-intensity blue
				collar jobs such as roofing and general construction in central Oregon, USA. After
				learning essential team management skills and becoming an effective foreman for my
				crew in less than 6 months, I began shifting my focus towards formal education.
				 My goal was to learn how to operate my own business with effective big-picture goals.
			 <br><br>I relocated near my preffered school, earned my first transfer degree,
			  and ulimately attended Portland State University in Portland, Oregon. During this
				time, I handled a career in private security for a
				premier full-service security and investigations company, Corpoarate Crime Control
				Association. I rapidly demonstrated potential in this industry as well, and after a
				year of service, I was personally handling multiple teams and client contracts in
				a project management role. <br><br>During my employment and schooling I developed
				an interest in tech. What started off as an interest soon turned into a deep held
				passion and I began teaching myself programmining languages such as JavaScript,
				Ruby, and R. I'm currently developing and refining these skill constantly, with
				eyes set on renowned vocational schools to take my expertise to the next level.
				As far as my formal education in business, By June 15th of 2019, I was walking
				with 2 degrees in specialized business knowledge: Management and Leadership,
				and Human Resource Management. The combination of my knowledge, skills, abilities
				and continuing experience speaks for itself in the market of people.

			<h1 class="center">Personal Interests</h1>
			<p class ="center">I've always been a person with many different hobbies to enjoy. On the
				weekends, you can find me hiking with my golden retriever, Rylee, or
			maybe snowboarding Mt. Hood given the right season. I like to sing and play
		 	music on guitar as well as listen to it! Roadtrips and international
			travel are a pretty normal occurence as well if I have the time for it.
			As well as all these, I love to capture my experiences with photography and
			 occasional videography. I even run a stable side business shooting portraits
			for various clients.<br><br></p>
